# Electromyogram (EMG) For Prosthetic Fingers Control

Identifying the movement of each finger and use that to 
control prosthetic devices movements.

EMG signals recorded from amputees residual muscles 
have been extensively investigated as a source of control 
for prosthetic devices, denoted as myoelectric control. 

we use different machine learning classification algorithms 
such as SVM, KNN on the recorded EMG signal.

various features in time and frequency domain were 
extracted, using features selection methods such as Wrapper 
Method we managed to drop unrelated features.
